Why LeLamp
LeLamp aims to be a friendly bridge between artful lighting and intelligent motion. The team built it to prove that a lamp can be more than a light source. It can respond to environment, patterns, and user needs without feeling gimmicky. The project emphasizes accessibility, open hardware, and clear documentation so students, hobbyists, and professionals can learn, modify, and extend the system.

Core Ideas and Design Principles
- Simplicity first: Clear interfaces and readable code. Components are chosen to minimize unnecessary complexity.
- Modularity: Each subsystem â€” lighting, motion, sensors, and control â€” is decoupled. You can replace a sensor or swap the LED driver with minimal changes.
- Reproducibility: The build and runtime behavior should be easy to reproduce on different hardware revisions.
- Safety and reliability: Power management and mechanical design focus on safe operation and long life.
- Accessibility: The docs explain how to assemble, program, and extend LeLamp without specialized equipment.

Hardware Overview
LeLamp relies on a compact controller board, a ring of addressable LEDs, a movable lamp head, and a small set of sensors. The hardware is designed around commonly available parts and a simple power architecture so builders can source parts from standard suppliers.

Key components
- Microcontroller: A capable ESP32-based controller with Wiâ€‘Fi and Bluetooth. It provides a robust base for lighting control, motion planning, and network communication.
- LED ring: A ring of individually addressable LEDs (e.g., WS2812B or SK6812) to create smooth, vibrant ambient lighting around the lamp head.
- Lamp head actuator: A small servo or micro-stepper motor to rotate or tilt the lamp head for expressive lighting angles.
- Sensors: A light sensor to gauge ambient brightness, an IR proximity sensor for basic interaction, and a temperature sensor to monitor the system.
- Power: A compact power supply that delivers safe current to the LED ring and the microcontroller, with protection features.
- Interfaces: USB-C for power and programming, optional GPIO headers for hobbyists who want to experiment with extra sensors or modules.

You'll find a complete bill of materials, assembly steps, and a proposed enclosure concept in the Hardware section of this README. The BOM is designed to be practical for hobbyists while still useful for small labs or classrooms.

Electrical and Mechanical Design
Electrical design emphasizes clean power delivery and minimal noise. The LED ring driver shares the same supply as the microcontroller but uses a level shifter and appropriate filtering to keep sensitive analog lines quiet. The lamp head motor is powered from a separate regulator to reduce jitter in lighting patterns when the motor runs.

Key electrical notes
- Power rails: 5V for the microcontroller and LED ring, with robust decoupling (1000 ÂµF bulk capacitor near the ring, plus 0.1 ÂµF + 1 ÂµF ceramics close to critical pins).
- LED data line: Prefer a short, shielded data line from the microcontroller to the LED ring. Use a level shifter if the ESP32 board voltage differs from the LED data line requirement.
- Sensors: Use proper pull-up or pull-down resistors on sensor lines and shielded cat5-like wiring if you plan to route sensors away from the motor.

Mechanical design notes
- Enclosure concept: A stylish, light sheet-metal or 3D-printed shell with a paper-like finish to echo the Apple Paper-inspired aesthetic. The head mounts on a low-backlash hinge to allow precise tilt angles.
- Mounting: The LED ring sits in a circular groove at the lampâ€™s base. The lamp head is mounted on a compact robotic arm with a gentle range of motion.
- Cable management: Internal channels keep wires tidy and prevent snagging on the moving head.

Firmware and Software Architecture
LeLamp splits responsibilities across firmware on the microcontroller and host software or scripts running on a PC or SBC. This separation makes the project easier to extend and test.

Firmware (microcontroller)
- Core tasks: LED control, motor control, sensor reading, and network communication.
- LED control: The firmware includes a driver for the LED ring with color blending, brightness control, and animation sequences.
- Motion control: A simple motion planner for tilting or rotating the lamp head, with safety checks to avoid collisions and over-travel.
- Sensor integration: Periodic sampling of ambient light and environment data. The firmware can publish sensor values to a local or remote controller via a lightweight protocol.
- Network stack: Wiâ€‘Fi or Bluetooth connection handling, with a minimal HTTP or WebSocket server for control and status reporting.

Host software (PC or SBC)
- Control API: A small server or CLI tools to query lamp status, start lighting patterns, and adjust motion.
- Pattern library: A set of lighting patterns designed to highlight the lampâ€™s geometry and movement. Patterns are modular and easy to extend.
- Scripting interface: A Python-based interface that lets users script complex scenes, scenes with motion, and sensor-driven automation.
- Data logging: Optional logging of sensor data and events to help you tune patterns and behavior.

Data formats and protocol
- The system uses a compact text-based protocol over a local network (JSON-like payloads for readability, with a binary-friendly variant if you opt for efficiency).
- Key messages include: status, set_pattern, set_brightness, move_head, get_sensors, and reboot.
- The protocol is designed to be simple to understand for new contributors while robust enough for scripted automation.

Detailed Design Notes for Hackers and Builders
- Software architecture: The host software is organized into modules with well-defined interfaces. The pattern engine is a pure function library that can be tested easily. The API layer abstracts network or message transport so you can swap in a different transport without changing core logic.
- Firmware architecture: The microcontroller firmware uses a lightweight event loop. Sensor sampling runs at a fixed cadence, while LED and motor commands are issued in response to events or timer callbacks.
- Pattern design: A pattern is a state machine with transitions driven by time, input, or sensor data. Each pattern exposes a start and stop function and a callback that updates the LED frame and motor state.

Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
- Power spikes: LED rings can pull significant current. Use proper decoupling and avoid long power runs that cause voltage dips.
- Motor interference: If the motor introduces noise, consider separate regulators and shielding for the motor wires.
- Sensor drift: Temperature and EMI can drift sensor readings. Calibrate sensors and provide compensation in software.
